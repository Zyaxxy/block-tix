# 🎟️ Decentralized Ticketing dApp

A Web3-powered event ticketing platform built on **Solana Devnet** that lets users generate their own wallet, mint NFT-based tickets, and auction them — all in a truly decentralized and transparent way.

## 🚀 Live Project

**URL**: [View Live]()

## 🧠 What’s Unique

Unlike traditional ticketing systems, this dApp:
- Gives users **true ownership** of their tickets via NFTs.
- Uses **on-chain auctions** (live + blind) for resale or premium tickets.
- Offers **wallet generation** inside the app, no extensions required.
- Supports **transparent resale** with verified metadata and QR-ready tickets.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **In-app Wallet Generation**  
  Secure wallets with mnemonic backup and password verification.

- 🎫 **Mint NFT Tickets**  
  Each ticket is an NFT minted directly to the user’s wallet on Solana Devnet.

- 📁 **My Tickets Page**  
  View all owned NFT tickets, complete with metadata and mint addresses.

- 📈 **Live Auctions** *(In Progress)*  
  Bid on tickets in real-time with countdowns and bid history.

- 🎭 **Blind Auctions** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Fair sealed bidding system for exclusive ticket drops.

- 🎨 **Create Your Own Auction** *(Planned)*  
  Users can auction their tickets — open or blind — from their wallet.
